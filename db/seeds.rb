Big statement, I know, but this place packs a serious punch. Chaotic Cairo itself has 5000+ years of layered archaeological history that blooms relentlessly around you like an onion at an Outback Steakhouse.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   When it comes to dishing out the good stuff, Egypt is a country that just can’t help itself. This is where history and mystery blend in a puzzling plethora of temples, hieroglyphics, statues, and stone monuments. Where ancient relics, of a scale and caliber unmatched anywhere else in the world, document a perfect record of the awe-inspiring ascent of our human civilization. 
  #   <br /><br />
  #   Through ancient sea beds and sand dunes, to towering minarets and imposing stone temples, Egypt never lets you forget where you are. The story of Egypt is the story of modern man, and all of it, the history, the culture, and the country’s very existence is dependent on inextricably linked to the ebb and flow of that most stirring and exalted of rivers: the Nile.")

Kenya is a wild and fascinating country. There is something deep within the rust-colored earth that binds us and reminds us that we are all in this together.

Before the selfie, and the instagram, before airbnb, and Uber, and all the things that have made the world so completely accessible and digestible to the western sensibilities. Of course when I was there I was traveling with someone who had been there in the 90’s. 'THOSE were the good old days of Thailand', he had explained. 'In the 90’s it was all pristine! Just a few hippies and beach huts. None of this gap year backpacker spring break party nonsense! …a man could eat his pad thai in peace!' ….But then, of course, a man sitting one table away from us corrected him saying, 'The 90’s were PACKED with tourists, that’s when it all went downhill! The 80’s! THAT was the best time to be in Thailand!'.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   Change is the inevitable monster that haunts the dreams of travelers who stumble onto the perfect place at what feels like the perfect time. But the truth is, while Thailand’s popularity has changed the nature of tourism in the country, it’s an extremely resilient place. Despite the onslaught of the fully-loaded, I-phone wielding, instagramming hordes descending en masse and tweeting their way across the country, Thai people remain welcoming and friendly. The coast line is as breath-taking as it ever was, and even though you might have to work a little harder for it, there are still some pretty incredible hidden gems tucked safely away from the less intrepid hordes of wanna-be youtube celebrities.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   This is a country that leaves an impact. There’s nowhere else on the planet that gives what Thailand gives, and she dishes it out in spades. The fact remains that no matter how old you are, or which decade you visit, you are always in the right place, at the right time in Thailand. I’ve been back 3 times since my first trip in 2005, and I’ll continue to visit until the day I die. If I could go every year, I would, if only to eat my face off.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   This is a place that never gets old. Where your senses are heightened, challenged, and revived. You can wax poetic about the 'old days', but the truth remains, no matter how much you’ve seen or how long you’ve stayed, there is always more to be discovered in Thailand.")

  #   intro: "Few places in the world are as geographically and geologically blessed as the country of Italy. Highly volcanic and mineral rich, the soil here is some of the most nutrient-filled and agriculturally viable in the world, a veritable arboretum for the seeds of human culture to take root.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   For centuries Celts, Greeks, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Etruscans all reaped the rewards of Italy’s central location on the Mediterranean sea, the superhighway of the ancient world. Late Bronze Age Phoenicians set up posts along coasts, kicking off an era of unprecedented sea trade. The great, temple-building Greeks constructed mammoth architectural works and asserted a cultural dominance equal in size and influence to the one on the Grecian mainland. The Etruscans established themselves under the Tuscan sun (ha!) as the dominate force in central Italy, ushering in a cultural renaissance the likes of which had never before existed in Europe. 
  #   <br /><br />
  #   And then of course, the world saw the rise of Rome. That scrappy little republic that rose out of the swamp to become the unquestioned master of the western world. Roman art, Roman industry, and Roman ideology transformed the ancient world irrevocably. It is the Roman force of will that has conveyed the Latin identity through the annals of history.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   Modern Italy is literally covered with the monuments of its forebears, and every step on the long march to the 21st century must involve a reckoning with the past. Things move slower in Italy than in other European neighbors, and both business and public works projects are often stalled, or abandoned all together due to the discovery of this or that archeological treasure buried below.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   The Italian way is a haphazard one, with its leaning towers and its rumbling volcanoes, and Italians, by and large, are animated and passionate. They are devout admirers of beauty, and understand how to find joy in the inherent chaos of life. Nowhere in the world are a people more dedicated to the craft of cooking (and eating), and more sure of the quality of their product.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   Italy is infectious, and despite its enormity, and its vast regional diversity, nothing here feels foreign for long.

The peoples of Europe, Africa, and Asia have, time and again, converged on this tiny rocky outcrop, intent on setting a new course for our civilizational evolution. Warfare, politics and the religions of the world have all hinged on which winds blew which ships across Malta’s craggy shores.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   Some of the humanity’s oldest standing monuments are found on Malta, with evidence of early settlements going back to the Neolithic era. These little islands, alone in the middle of a vast sea, served as a weigh station for ancient settlers, and  Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans have all left an indelible mark here. Homer wrote about Malta in The Odyssey, as the mythical home of Calypso, the enchantress, and the final resting place of many an ancient shipwreck.
  #   <br /><br />
  #   St Paul (of Biblical fame) is said to have crash-landed on Malta, and he didn’t waste any time before proselytizing and converting the confused Roman populace. As soon as Islam came onto the scene, the island became locked in a tug-of-war between these two dominate religions, until 1565, when the Siege of Malta ended the dispute and put the islands firmly under Christian control. Since then the islands have continued to live somewhere in-between Africa and Europe, on a plane of existence all it’s own. It’s this blending of culture that gives the Maltese people their unique national character, an identity forged over thousands of years, and defined by their place at the crossroads of the world.")
